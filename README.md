the issue is the generate moves fn in occupations.py. the project desc says "As mentioned in class, you must modify the graph and not the BFS. Modifying BFS against
instructions will result in a minimum deduction of 25 points from your overall score on
this project. Using a graph traversal algorithm to create the graph model falls into the same
category as modifying the algorithm. The model should not be created via a traversal, or
the 25-point deduction will apply. The entire graph must be created explicitly (rather than
implicitly) before the execution of the BFS. We realize this may not be the most efficient
solution method (discuss in your complexity analysis if desired)."
